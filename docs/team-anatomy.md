# Team Anatomy (Runtime Reference)

A single concrete example of what a running ClawCross team looks like on disk. We use **`paper-review-council`** as the case study because it touches every file kind a team can have: internal agents, persona prompts, a YAML workflow, a Python workflow, team-scoped SKILLs, and preset stamps.

> If you want command-line creation, read [`build_team.md`](./build_team.md). If you want the browser flow, read [`team-creator.md`](./team-creator.md). For the full YAML grammar see [`create_workflow.md`](./create_workflow.md). This document is just "what is a team made of."

---

## 1. Where the team lives

```
<CLAWCROSS_HOME>/data/user_files/<user_id>/teams/<team_name>/
```

For the example below: `~/.clawcross/data/user_files/default/teams/paper-review-council/`.

`CLAWCROSS_HOME` defaults to `~/.clawcross` (override with the env var). Forbidden in `<team_name>`: `/`, `\`, leading `.`.

        ├── run.sh
        ├── run.py
        ├── pyproject.toml
        └── runtime_config.example.json
```

The minimum to be a usable team is `internal_agents.json` + `oasis_experts.json` + at least one workflow under `oasis/yaml/` or `oasis/python/`.

Cron / alarm storage is **not** in the team folder — internal alarms live in `<DATA_DIR>/timeset/tasks.json` and join to teams by `session_id`.

---

## 3. `internal_agents.json` — role bindings

A flat list. Each entry is a long-lived participant ("internal agent") inside the team. `session` is its runtime id; `tag` says which persona prompt it speaks with.

```json
[
  { "name": "搜索指挥者",  "tag": "search_commander" },
  { "name": "论文汇报者",  "tag": "paper_reporter"   }
]
```

When this file is loaded into a running team, each entry gains a `session` field stamped automatically:

```json
{ "name": "搜索指挥者", "tag": "search_commander", "session": "mp9u8ywjl405" }
```

- `name` — display name shown in chat / `/team … members`. Also used by `expert: <tag>#oasis#<name>` refs in YAML workflows.
- `tag` — must match a `tag` in `oasis_experts.json` (or in the public persona pool).
- `session` — runtime-only. Stripped on snapshot export, regenerated on import.

A team does not own its agents; this file is the team's **manifest** of roles. Each role is bound to an agent in the agent registry, which gives every agent a stable id (`ag_…`) and address (`<user>/<handle>`, e.g. `default/search_commander`):

- an entry without `session` (written by hand or by team-builder's `write_file`) is a new agent — the session is stamped the first time the team is read, and written back in this same format;
- an entry that names an existing `session` refers to that agent, so one agent can serve several teams under different role names.

The entry marked `"is_primary": true` leads the team: `POST /v1/teams/<team>/messages`, or an OpenAI-compatible request with `model: "<user>/<team>"`, goes to it. `GET /v1/agents` and `GET /v1/teams` list agents and teams with their ids and addresses.

---

## 4. `oasis_experts.json` — persona prompts

A flat list of **prompts**, not agents. Multiple internal agents with the same `tag` share one prompt; multiple `#temp#` references in a workflow also reuse the same prompt entry.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "搜索指挥者",
    "tag": "search_commander",
    "persona": "你是团队中的内部 Agent「搜索指挥者」，负责在论文搜索/审读开始前制定检索与审读调度方案…\n\n输出格式：\n[搜索指挥]\n候选专家: tag - 适用范围\n选择专家: tag1, tag2, ...\n主搜索persona: tag1\n搜索重点:\n- tag1: ...",
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "category": "orchestration",
    "description": "内部 Agent 的检索调度与专家选择人设。"
  },
  {
    "name": "机器学习论文审读专家",
    "tag": "ml_reviewer",
    "persona": "你是机器学习与人工智能方向的论文审读专家。\n\n重点审理：模型结构、训练目标、数据划分、基线选择、消融实验…",
    "temperature": 0.4,
    "category": "computer-science",
    "description": "审理 ML/AI/CV/NLP/多模态论文。"
  }
]
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name`, `tag`, `persona` | yes | Prompt body in `persona`; multi-line via `\n`. |
| `temperature` | no | Float, 0.3 strict ↔ 0.9 creative. |
| `category`, `description` | no | Free-form, used by listing UIs. |
| `model`, `api_key`, `base_url`, `provider` | no | Per-persona LLM override; falls back to global `LLM_*` env vars when omitted. |

> **Lookup rule:** when the runtime resolves an `expert:` ref, it matches by `tag` first, then by `name`. Get the tag wrong and the agent silently falls back to a public-pool persona of that tag, or fails to find one.

---

## 5. `external_agents.json` — external / OpenClaw agents

Empty `[]` or missing means "no externals". This team's file is currently empty; here is the shape from `demo_team`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "my_new_agent",
    "tag": "openclaw",
    "global_name": "my_new_agent",
    "meta": {
      "api_url": "",
      "api_key": "",
      "model": "",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
]
```

- `tag` — ACP routing key. `"openclaw"` for OpenClaw agents (recommended); `codex` / `claude` / `gemini` / `aider` also valid.
- `global_name` — runtime-only globally-unique id. Stripped on export, regenerated on import.
- `meta` — backend connection skeleton. For OpenClaw agents the real config lives in the OpenClaw session and must be synced into JSON via `openclaw snapshot export`.

A workflow references one as `expert: openclaw#ext#<name>`.

---

## 6. `oasis/yaml/<workflow>.yaml` — YAML workflow

`paper_review_council.yaml` — search commander fans out to 7 domain reviewers, all converge on the reporter:

```yaml
version: 2
repeat: false
plan:
- id: p0
  manual: { author: begin, content: "请提供要审读的论文信息…" }

- id: p1
  expert: search_commander#oasis#搜索指挥者          # <tag>#oasis#<name> → stateful internal agent
  instruction: "请根据论文信息…输出应选择的专家 tag。"

- id: p2
  expert: ml_reviewer#temp#1                          # <tag>#temp#<seed> → stateless persona
- id: p3
  expert: systems_reviewer#temp#1
# … p4..p8 are sibling domain reviewers …

- id: p9
  expert: paper_reporter#oasis#论文汇报者

- id: p10
  manual: { author: bend, content: "论文审读汇报已完成。" }

edges:
- [p0, p1]
- [p1, p2]                                            # commander fans out to all 7 reviewers
- [p1, p3]
- [p1, p4]
- [p1, p5]
- [p1, p6]
- [p1, p7]
- [p1, p8]
- [p2, p9]                                            # all reviewers converge on reporter
- [p3, p9]
- [p4, p9]
- [p5, p9]
- [p6, p9]
- [p7, p9]
- [p8, p9]
- [p9, p10]
```

Node forms (see `create_workflow.md` for the full grammar):

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `manual: { author, content }` | No LLM call; injects fixed text. `begin` / `bend` are the conventional book-ends. |
| `expert: "<tag>#oasis#<name>"` | LLM call by a **stateful** internal agent (must exist in `internal_agents.json`). |
| `expert: "<tag>#temp#<seed>"` | LLM call by a **stateless** persona lookup; `<seed>` is a temperature/seed hint. |
| `expert: "openclaw#ext#<name>"` | Delegates to an external agent (must exist in `external_agents.json`). |
| Add `selector: true` | The node's output is treated as a routing key, consumed by `selector_edges:`. |

`edges` are unconditional fan-out / fan-in. Selector nodes use `selector_edges:` instead.

---

## 7. `oasis/python/<workflow>.py` — Python workflow

YAML is enough for fixed graphs, but `paper-review-council` needs to:

1. Parse the user's free-text question for `--topic`, `--max-papers`, conferences/arxiv hints.
2. Ask the search commander persona which 1–3 domain experts to invoke.
3. Subprocess-run `skills/paper-survey/run.sh` (a system command) and stream its progress to the chat.
4. Pass the survey output into each selected expert and the final reporter.

That's dynamic dispatch over data the YAML grammar can't express, so it's written in Python.

### 7.1 The contract

A workflow file is a regular Python module that:

```python
from oasis.workflow import Context, workflow

@workflow
async def main(ctx: Context):
    # ... your orchestration here ...
    ctx.set_result({"key": "value"})
    ctx.set_conclusion("one-line summary shown to the user")
```

- Decorate with `@workflow` (from `oasis.workflow`). If the file is executed as a script (`python my_wf.py …`) the decorator runs the function via `run_cli` and exits. If the file is imported (e.g. for tests) the decorator returns the function unchanged.
- `main` is `async def main(ctx: Context)`. The runtime awaits it.
- `oasis.workflow` import-time side-effects: re-exec into `$CLAWCROSS_VENV_DIR/bin/python` if needed, add project to `sys.path`, load `$CLAWCROSS_CONFIG_DIR/.env`. You do not have to do any of this yourself.
- The file lives at `teams/<team>/oasis/python/<wf>.py`. That fixes its on-disk path:
  ```python
  Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]   # == teams/<team>/
  ```

### 7.2 What `ctx` gives you

`ctx` is `StandaloneWorkflowContext` (re-exported as `Context`).

**Fields (set by the runtime before `main` is called):**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ctx.user_id` | User id who started the workflow. |
| `ctx.team` | Team folder name. |
| `ctx.question` | The free-text input the user typed (the argument to `clawcross workflow run … question <text>`). |
| `ctx.run_id` | Short unique id for this run; safe for filenames. |
| `ctx.topic_id` | Topic id if `auto_topic` was on (else `None`). |

**Async methods (call with `await`):**

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `await ctx.publish(content, author="…")` | Push a message to the user-visible topic. Use this for progress updates and final reports. |
| `await ctx.send_persona(tag, prompt)` | Invoke a persona by `tag`. Returns a result object with `.content`, `.ok`, `.error`. |
| `await ctx.send_agent(target, prompt, ...)` | Invoke a specific agent (by session) — used when you have a session id from `list_agents()`. |
| `await ctx.create_empty_topic(question=...)` | Start a fresh topic (only needed when `auto_topic=False`). |
| `await ctx.publish_to_topic(topic_id=..., author=..., content=...)` | Direct topic write. |
| `await ctx.conclude_topic(topic_id=..., conclusion=...)` | Close a topic. |

**Sync helpers:**

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ctx.list_agents()` | List `internal_agents.json` entries (with sessions). |
| `ctx.list_personas()` | List `oasis_experts.json` entries. |
| `ctx.get_agent(target)` / `ctx.get_persona(target)` | Lookup by name or tag. |
| `ctx.set_result(value)` | Store the structured final result (becomes the workflow's return payload). |
| `ctx.set_conclusion(text)` | Store the human-readable one-liner shown at the end. |

### 7.4 How a Python workflow is launched

```bash
clawcross workflow run paper_survey_workflow team paper-review-council question "审 attention is all you need"
# CLI dispatch: the runtime sees a .py file under teams/<team>/oasis/python/,
# spawns it with `python -m oasis.python_workflow_runner --workflow … --question …`
```

Or from the chatbot: `/cross workflow run paper_survey_workflow team paper-review-council question 审 attention is all you need`.

The runner sets up `ctx`, awaits `main(ctx)`, captures the result, and posts the conclusion back to the topic.

### 7.5 Python-workflow rules of thumb

- One file = one workflow. Multiple workflows = multiple `.py` files.
- Anything you `import` must be available in the venv that runs it. Standard library is fine; third-party deps that don't come with the ClawCross venv need their own install path (typically inside a team SKILL's `run.sh`).
- Always derive paths from `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`, not hardcoded strings. The team folder may be renamed.
- Prefer `await ctx.publish(...)` over `print()` — `print` lands in the runner's stdout, not in the user's chat.
- A long subprocess should stream into `ctx.publish` so the user can watch progress, not return one giant blob.
- Errors raised from `main` end the workflow with a failure. To finish cleanly with a partial result, catch the error and call `ctx.set_conclusion("..."); ctx.set_result({...})` yourself.

## 8. SKILLs — where they live and how they're scoped

A SKILL is a small instruction pack (`SKILL.md` + optional scripts) that an agent reads and follows. ClawCross has **two scopes**:

### 8.1 User-global skills

```
<CLAWCROSS_HOME>/data/user_files/<user_id>/skills/
├── SKILLS_INDEX.md
├── docx/SKILL.md
├── xlsx/SKILL.md
├── pdf/SKILL.md
├── productivity/pptx/SKILL.md
└── …
```

Every team that user owns can use these. This is where general-purpose skills go — file format helpers (docx / xlsx / pdf / pptx), self-improvement loggers, doc co-authoring, etc.

For the `default` user on this machine: `~/.clawcross/data/user_files/default/skills/`.

### 8.2 Team-scoped skills

```
<CLAWCROSS_HOME>/data/user_files/<user_id>/teams/<team_name>/skills/
├── SKILLS_INDEX.md                     # auto-regenerated; don't edit by hand
└── paper-survey/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── run.sh
    ├── run.py
    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── runtime_config.example.json
```

Only that one team sees these. Use this scope when the SKILL is meaningless outside the team — e.g. `paper-review-council` ships `paper-survey` here because that script is what its Python workflow actually executes.

### 8.3 Lookup order

When the runtime (`src/webot/skills.py::_scope_skills_dir`) builds the SKILL list for an agent in team T, it merges:

```
team scope:     <user_files>/<user>/teams/<T>/skills/
personal scope: <user_files>/<user>/skills/
```

Team-scoped wins on name collision. `SKILLS_INDEX.md` in each scope is regenerated when a SKILL is added/removed.

### 8.4 Adding a SKILL

Either drop the directory onto disk and let the index regen pick it up, or use the API:

```
POST /teams/<team>/skills/import-zip      # upload a zip → team scope
GET  /teams/<team>/skills                  # list team-scope skills
GET  /teams/<team>/skills/<name>           # read a SKILL.md
```

A SKILL is plain Markdown with frontmatter; nothing in the runtime *runs* it. The agent decides to read `SKILL.md`, then follows it (running scripts via `run_command`, writing source via `write_file`, etc.).

---

## 9. Preset stamps

Teams that were installed from a built-in preset (`data/team_presets/<id>/`) carry two extra files copied verbatim:

```json
// clawcross_preset_manifest.json
{
  "preset_id": "paper-review-council",
  "name": "论文审读汇报团",
  "role_count": 2,
  "persona_count": 9,
  "workflow_files": ["paper_review_council.yaml"],
  "python_workflow_files": ["paper_survey_workflow.py"],
  "default_team_name": "论文审读汇报团",
  "tags": ["paper-review", "research"]
}
```

```json
// clawcross_preset_source_map.json
{
  "preset_id": "paper-review-council",
  "roles": {
    "search_commander": { "name": "搜索指挥者", "source_file": "...", "kind": "internal_agent" },
    "ml_reviewer":      { "name": "机器学习论文审读专家", "source_file": "...", "kind": "persona" }
  }
}
```

These are informational. The runtime does not require them; only `clawcross team … overview` and the Creator UI use them to show "installed from preset X."

---

## 10. Cron / scheduled triggers

Alarms (cron-scheduled or one-shot) live **outside** the team folder, in a global tasks file:

```
<CLAWCROSS_DATA_DIR>/timeset/tasks.json
```

A task joins back to a team via `session_id`: `internal` targets store the internal agent's `session` from `internal_agents.json`; `external` targets store `ext:<global_name>` from `external_agents.json`. When a team is exported as a snapshot, its alarm rows are *extracted* from `tasks.json` via `export_team_alarms()`; on import they are *restored* with `restore_team_alarms()` after fresh sessions are stamped.

### 10.1 Create a cron alarm

**CLI** (interactive prompts fill in any missing field):

```bash
clawcross cron new \
  team   "<team>" \
  target "<internal agent name | external alias>" \
  type   internal|external \
  cron   "0 9 * * 1"           # OR  once  "2026-06-01T09:00:00"
  text   "周一 9 点提醒整理论文进展"
```

`target` matches the `name` of an internal agent (resolved to `session_id` automatically) or the `name` of an external agent (resolved to `ext:<global_name>`). Get it wrong and the API returns `Internal/External target not found`.

**HTTP** (session-authenticated):

```
POST /teams/<team>/alarms
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target_type":   "internal",                      # "internal" | "external"
  "target_name":   "搜索指挥者",                    # resolved by name → session
  "schedule_type": "cron",                          # "cron" | "once"
  "cron":          "0 9 * * 1",                     # required when schedule_type=cron
  "run_at":        "2026-06-01T09:00:00",           # required when schedule_type=once
  "text":          "周一 9 点提醒整理论文进展"
}
```

The front server resolves `target_name` against the team's `internal_agents.json` / `external_agents.json`, forwards the payload to the Scheduler service (`POST <SCHEDULER>/tasks`), and returns the scheduler's reply with `task_id`.

### 10.2 List & delete

```bash
clawcross cron                            # all teams + personal
clawcross cron "<team>"                   # one team
```

```
GET    /teams/<team>/alarms               # team alarms + valid targets
DELETE /teams/<team>/alarms/<task_id>     # delete by id (only within this team)
```

The mobile UI uses the same handler under `/mobile_alarms`.

### 10.3 What an alarm does at fire time

When the scheduler ticks, it posts `text` into the topic system as if the user sent it, addressed to the resolved `session_id` (internal) or external agent. Internal targets resume their existing session (memory preserved); external targets receive a fresh delegation. Either way the message lands in the agent's normal message flow.

## 11. DIY: edit a team directly with `write_file` / `run_command`

The CLI and Creator UI are convenience — under the hood a team is just files. If you have shell access (or the `write_file` / `read_file` / `run_command` MCP tools), you can build or edit a team entirely by writing those files yourself. Two valid styles:

### 11.1 Build from scratch by writing files

```bash
TEAM=~/.clawcross/data/user_files/default/teams/quick-demo
mkdir -p "$TEAM/oasis/yaml"  "$TEAM/oasis/python"  "$TEAM/skills"
```

Then write the four core files. Minimum to be loadable:

```bash
# internal_agents.json — one stateful agent
cat > "$TEAM/internal_agents.json" <<'JSON'
[
  { "name": "Coordinator", "tag": "coordinator" }
]
JSON

# oasis_experts.json — the matching persona prompt
cat > "$TEAM/oasis_experts.json" <<'JSON'
[
  {
    "name": "Coordinator",
    "tag":  "coordinator",
    "persona": "你是协调者。把用户任务拆成 3-5 步并指派 SKILL。\n输出格式：[计划] ...",
    "temperature": 0.35
  }
]
JSON

# oasis/yaml/quick.yaml — a 3-node workflow
cat > "$TEAM/oasis/yaml/quick.yaml" <<'YAML'
version: 2
repeat: false
plan:
- id: q0
  manual: { author: begin, content: "请描述任务。" }
- id: q1
  expert: coordinator#oasis#Coordinator
- id: q2
  manual: { author: bend,  content: "已规划。" }
edges:
- [q0, q1]
- [q1, q2]
YAML
```

`session` ids are stamped automatically on first load — you don't need to write them yourself, but doing so is fine (just keep them unique within the file).

When run from inside an MCP agent, the same writes go through the file tool:

```
write_file(filename="teams/quick-demo/internal_agents.json", content="[ … ]")
write_file(filename="teams/quick-demo/oasis_experts.json",   content="[ … ]")
write_file(filename="teams/quick-demo/oasis/yaml/quick.yaml", content="version: 2\n…")
```

`filename` is the **required** parameter — not `path` / `name`. Paths are relative to the user's sandbox root, which contains the `teams/` subtree.

### 11.2 Edit an existing team in place

The same trick works to surgically change one file: read it, edit the JSON / YAML, write it back. The runtime re-reads files on every workflow run, so changes take effect immediately (no service restart, no re-install).

Typical edits:

| Change | Touch this file |
|---|---|
| Add a new persona / change a prompt / tune temperature | `oasis_experts.json` |
| Add a new role / rename a session | `internal_agents.json` |
| Wire in an OpenClaw agent | `external_agents.json` |
| Reroute the workflow / add a parallel branch | `oasis/yaml/<wf>.yaml` |
| Rewrite the dynamic orchestration | `oasis/python/<wf>.py` |
| Change the team-wide fallback agent | `team_settings.json` |

### 11.3 Things to keep consistent when DIY-editing

The checklist below saves debugging time. Same items as §12 "binding picture," repeated here so you don't have to scroll:

1. Every `tag` in `internal_agents.json` has a matching `tag` in `oasis_experts.json` (or in the public persona pool).
2. Every `<tag>#oasis#<name>` in a YAML workflow exists in `internal_agents.json` with that exact `tag` + `name`.
3. Every `openclaw#ext#<name>` in a YAML workflow exists in `external_agents.json`.
4. `session` ids are unique within `internal_agents.json`; `global_name` unique within `external_agents.json`.
5. YAML graph: every `edges` endpoint is a declared `id`; selectors use `selector_edges:`, not `edges:`.
6. Python workflow: derive paths from `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`, not hardcoded strings.

### 11.4 When CLI / Creator is still better

- You need to **provision an OpenClaw backend** — `openclaw sessions add` + `openclaw snapshot export` is the only way to get the real backend config into `external_agents.json`. Hand-editing the JSON leaves the actual OpenClaw side empty.
- You need a **fresh `session_id`** stamped — pass through `install_team_preset()` or the Creator; or just leave the field off and the loader will stamp one on first load.
- You want a **ZIP snapshot** with runtime fields properly stripped — use `POST /api/team-creator/download`, not zip the folder by hand.

For everything else, file editing is the shortest path.

## 12. Cross-file binding (one picture)

```
oasis_experts.json   ◄── matched by tag ──   internal_agents.json
   tag: "search_commander"                       tag: "search_commander"
   name: "搜索指挥者"                            name: "搜索指挥者"
   persona: "你是…"                              session: "mp9u…"  ← runtime
                  ▲                                    ▲
                  │ used by name+tag                   │ session binds identity
                  │                                    │
                  └──── oasis/yaml/<wf>.yaml ──────────┘
                        expert: search_commander#oasis#搜索指挥者
                                  ▲                ▲
                                  tag              name


external_agents.json  ◄── matched by name ──  oasis/yaml/<wf>.yaml
   name: "my_new_agent"                         expert: openclaw#ext#my_new_agent
   tag: "openclaw"
   global_name: "..."  ← runtime


oasis/python/<wf>.py  ── calls ──►  ctx.send_persona("<tag>", prompt)
                                     ctx.send_agent("<session_or_name>", prompt)
                                     ctx.list_personas() / ctx.list_agents()
```

**When something looks wrong:**

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Workflow runs but the agent has the wrong personality | `oasis_experts.json` missing the tag → silent fallback to public-pool persona. |
| Workflow halts with "unknown expert" | `expert: <tag>#oasis#<name>` references a `name` with no matching `internal_agents.json` entry. |
| External node returns "agent not found" | `external_agents.json` lacks the `name`, or OpenClaw `snapshot export` never ran. |
| Python workflow crashes before `main` | venv missing a package, or `from oasis.workflow import …` couldn't reach the project root. |
| Agents have stale context after re-install | `session` ids changed on install — sessions are runtime-only and don't survive a fresh install. |

## 13. Inspecting a live team

```bash
clawcross team "<team>"               # overview (members + alarm count)
clawcross team "<team>" members       # internal + external
clawcross team "<team>" personas      # oasis_experts.json
clawcross team "<team>" workflows     # yaml + python workflows
clawcross team "<team>" skills        # team-scoped SKILLs
clawcross team "<team>" crons         # cron alarms

clawcross workflow show <wf> team "<team>"
clawcross workflow run  <wf> team "<team>" question "<text…>"
```

Raw inspection:

```bash
cd ~/.clawcross/data/user_files/<user>/teams/<team>/
cat internal_agents.json oasis_experts.json external_agents.json
ls oasis/yaml/  oasis/python/  skills/
```
